## Live Deployment

The RESTful Book Management API is deployed on Render.

**Live API URL:** [https://backend-lab-3-ziaw.onrender.com](https://backend-lab-3-ziaw.onrender.com)

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | Welcome message |
| GET | `/about/` | API information |
| GET | `/books/` | Retrieve all books |
| GET | `/books/:bookId/` | Retrieve a book by ID |
| POST | `/books/` | Add a new book |
| PUT | `/books/:bookId/` | Update a book |
| DELETE | `/books/:bookId/` | Delete a book |


## Project Objective

The objective of this lab is to develop a RESTful API using Express.js and SQLite to manage book records.

The application implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and provides additional features such as searching, sorting, filtering, and pagination through query parameters.

This lab demonstrates database connectivity, asynchronous operations using async/await, parameterized SQL queries, request validation, error handling, and REST API development.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQLite
- SQLite3
- JavaScript (CommonJS)
- Postman
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git and GitHub

## Database Structure

**Database Name:** `books.db`

**Table Name:** `book`

| Column | Data Type                         | Description            |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| id     | INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | Unique book identifier |
| title  | TEXT                              | Book title             |
| author | TEXT                              | Author name            |
| price  | INTEGER                           | Book price             |
| pages  | INTEGER                           | Number of pages        |

The database contains sample book records used to test the API operations. The final verification returned 14 remaining book records after the deletion test.

## Installation and Execution

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Visual Studio Code or another code editor.
- Git installed.
- Postman installed.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Application

Run:

```bash
node app.js
```

The server runs at:

```text
http://localhost:3000/
```

### 3. Database Connection

The application connects to the SQLite database using the `sqlite` and `sqlite3` packages.

The database connection is established before the Express server starts. The `book` table is created if it does not already exist.

### Example Requests

**Search books by title**

```text
GET /books/?search_q=harry
```

**Sort books by price, highest to lowest**

```text
GET /books/?order_by=price&order=DESC
```

**Retrieve the first five books**

```text
GET /books/?limit=5&offset=0
```

**Filter books by price range**

```text
GET /books/?min_price=400&max_price=600
```

## CRUD Operations

### 1. GET All Books

**Endpoint:** `GET /books/`

Retrieves book records stored in the database. The endpoint also supports query parameters for searching, sorting, filtering, and pagination.

### 2. GET Book by ID

**Endpoint:** `GET /books/:bookId/`

Retrieves a specific book using its unique ID. If the requested book does not exist, the API returns a not-found response.

### 3. POST a New Book

**Endpoint:** `POST /books/`

Adds a new book record to the database.

Example JSON request body:

```json
{
  "title": "The Power of Habit",
  "author": "Charles Duhigg",
  "price": 420,
  "pages": 371
}
```

### 4. PUT Update Book

**Endpoint:** `PUT /books/:bookId/`

Updates the details of an existing book using its ID.

Example JSON request body:

```json
{
  "title": "Atomic Habits Updated",
  "author": "James Clear",
  "price": 500,
  "pages": 350
}
```

### 5. DELETE Book

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /books/:bookId/`

Deletes a specific book from the database using its ID.

If the requested book does not exist, the API returns a not-found response.

## Validation and Error Handling

The application validates incoming request data and handles invalid requests.

The following validation tests were performed:

- POST request with missing required data.
- POST request with an invalid price.
- Request with an invalid `order_by` value.
- Request with an invalid sorting order.
- PUT request using a book ID that does not exist.
- DELETE request using a book ID that does not exist.

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for invalid input and missing book records.

## Postman Testing

- Inserting, updating, and deleting records using `db.run()`.
- Using parameterized SQL queries with `?` placeholders.
- Accessing URL parameters through `request.params`.
- Accessing JSON request data through `request.body`.
- Accessing query parameters through `request.query`.
- Implementing searching, sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- Validating user input and handling errors.
- Testing REST API endpoints using Postman.

## Git Hygiene

The following entries should be included in `.gitignore`:

```text
node_modules/
.env
```

Do not commit `node_modules/`, environment files, API keys, passwords, or other sensitive credentials.

## Conclusion

This lab provided practical experience in developing a RESTful API using Express.js and SQLite. It helped develop an understanding of database connectivity, CRUD operations, query parameters, searching, sorting, filtering, pagination, and request validation.

The API was tested using Postman, including successful requests and error-handling scenarios.
